<h1>About Me</h1>
       <p>My name is yohanes habtemariam  I am currently a student and part-time worker at a Univer, 
  and my journey has been shaped by my upbringing in Bedele, a small town located 
  483 kilometers from Addis Ababa Ethiopia. Growing up in this environment, I navigated my 
  education from grade 1 to 12, where I consistently excelled despite the challenges
   posed by limited resources.</p>

   My father, Ato Habtemariam, was a military officer who served his country
    during the Derg regime. He is currently a trader in various rural districts.
     My mother's name is Martha Berhanu. She is a housewife. I have two older and 
     younger brothers. I am the second child in our family.</p>

   Although I did not have the knowledge to compare with children from the developed country Students , 
   I was one of the smartest children in my area. I enjoy the types of education, mathematics and chemistry.
    Even though when I was young, I enjoyed listening to technology-related news
    in addition to football games. I never missed the technology program hosted by Solomon Getachew on EBS 
    TV every Friday at 2:30 PM. this is about my short story from beddele to addis-abeba Ethiopia</p>
